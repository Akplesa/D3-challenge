# D3-challenge
In this challenge I created a Healthcare vs. Poverty scatterplot based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates using data from https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml .This scatter plot was created using D3 techniques as well as python -m http.server to run the visiualization.
